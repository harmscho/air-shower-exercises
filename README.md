# air-showers-exercises
This repository contains exercises to familiarize graduate students with the detection of extensive air shower induced by cosmic particles. 

To get started setup a folder on your machine to work on:  
* `mkdir -p $HOME/GradDays2019/AstroParticle`  

Get the git-repository with exercises on your local machine:  
* `cd $HOME/GradDays2019/AstroParticle`  
* `git clone https://github.com/harmscho/air-shower-exercises.git` 

In case you have not a working python + ipython notebook installation we recommend to setup a python enviroment using the `setup-python.sh` script:  
* `cd $HOME/GradDays2019/AstroParticle/air-shower-exercises`  
* `source python-setup.sh`

This will download the mini-conda package python package manager and install the packages that can be used for the exercise. If you already have a working python installation (with `ipython notebooks`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`)
